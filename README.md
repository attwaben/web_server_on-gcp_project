# web_server_on-gcp_project

1- I created a bucket to store images to be used on the website.

2- Uploaded the images and made them public to the internet .

3- I created a vm instance.

4- ssh the instance and installed apache2.

5- Created index.html in dir  /var/www/html .

6- Made some adjustments to the index.html file to import the images from the storage bucket.

The index html file is a template from bootstrap templates on which I made some adjustments to embed photos and a youtube video and a form .
